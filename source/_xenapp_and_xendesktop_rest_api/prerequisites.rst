Prerequisites for using APIs
============================

Prerequisites
=============
* The REST APIs described in the XenApp and XenDesktop APIs section apply to the XenApp and XenDesktop Service.
* All XenApp and XenDesktop REST API calls will need to provide a Citrix Cloud bearer token in the ``Authorization`` header and a ``customerId`` in the request URL.
* The `getting started <../getting_started.html>`_ section explains how to get the bearer token and customerId.
* An Azure subscription should already be linked to the customer's account via the Citrix Cloud UI.
